Ben Blackburne
--------------

I work for [Papers] doing Cocoa development and data science with a side of node.js. In a previous existence I was a computational biologist.

Previous Projects
-----------------

*[Abstrac] is an iPad app that lets scientists track the new papers that are being discussed on Twitter.

*[MetAl] is a tool in Haskell for measuring the distance between alternative sequence alignments.

*[webMetAl] is a new tool for visualising the MetAl metrics on the web. It is written entirely in JavaScript and the calculations take place in your browser.

*[Phyhs] is a library in Haskell for implementing phylogenetic models.
